# Agents

## Scratchpad

A `SCRATCHPAD.md` file may exist in the repo root. It's gitignored working memory for agent sessions — disposable context like model suggestions, open questions, and session notes.

Read it at session start if it exists. Update it when there's context worth carrying forward. Don't treat it as authoritative.

Use it sparingly. Decisions, rationale, and design artifacts belong in issues and PRs where they're visible and reviewable. The scratchpad is for context that would be more noise than signal in those places but helps local development — things like suggested model settings, sequencing notes, and session-specific reminders.
