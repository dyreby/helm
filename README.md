# Helm

A personal, Rust-based CLI for disciplined collaboration with a coding agent.

You steer, the agent advises, nothing moves without you. The helm waits for you.

Inspired by John Boyd's OODA loop, Michael Singer's practice of serving the moment unfolding in front of us, and my dad's love of sailing.

Built around [dyreby/collaboration-framework](https://github.com/dyreby/collaboration-framework), which started as a way to work better with a coding agent and evolved into something more general. Helm picks up where that project's extension-based approach ran into friction — replacing prompt engineering with structured, artifact-driven workflows.

**This is a personal tool.** It reflects how I think and work. If it resonates with you, that's great — explore, ask questions, take ideas, fork it. If you adapt something and it works well for you, I'd love to hear about it.

See [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the why. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the how.
