# Helm

A CLI for structured, artifact-driven workflows.
Observe the world, act upon it, and record everything in an append-only logbook.

Built around [dyreby/collaboration-framework](https://github.com/dyreby/collaboration-framework),
which started as a way to work better with a coding agent and evolved into something more general.
Helm picks up where that project's extension-based approach ran into friction —
replacing prompt engineering with structured, composable CLI commands.

**This is a personal tool.** It reflects how I think and work.
If it resonates with you, that's great — explore, ask questions, take ideas, fork it.

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) for the purpose, [VISION.md](VISION.md) for the approach, and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the specifics.
