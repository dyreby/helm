# Vision

Helm is how I want to work with a coding agent.

I want to set the course, trust my crew, and review the logbook along the way.

## Principles

- **Non-interactive.** Arguments in, output out. Commands compose with pipes, files, and scripts.
- **Caller-agnostic.** Helm serves whoever calls it — human, agent, or script.
- **Permanent record.** What's recorded stays recorded.
- **Trust the voyage.** The record is always yours to review.
- **Bring your own tools.** Helm orchestrates; external tools do the specialized work.
- **Joy matters.** Language shapes how a tool feels to use. The nautical theme is helpful and fun. ⛵️
