# Vision

Helm is how I want to work with a coding agent.

I want to set the course, trust my agent to crew the voyage, and review the logbook along the way.

## Principles

- **Non-interactive.** Arguments in, output out. Commands compose with pipes, files, and scripts.
- **Caller-agnostic.** Helm serves whoever calls it — human, agent, or script.
- **Permanent record.** What's recorded stays recorded.
- **Trust the voyage.** The record is always yours to review.
- **Bring your own tools.** Helm orchestrates; external tools do the specialized work.
- **Joy matters.** Language shapes how a tool feels to use. The nautical theme is helpful and fun. ⛵️

## Inspirations

Helm is inspired in part by John Boyd's OODA loop, Michael Singer's model of reality as a series of moments unfolding in front of us, and my dad's love of sailing. It's a personal tool, deeply shaped by how I think, tuned to my preferred way of working, and not trying to be general. If it evolves in a way that's useful to you along the way, that's wonderful.
