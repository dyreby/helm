# Vision

Helm is how I want to work with a coding agent.

I shape what the system can do — the types of observations it can take, the actions it can perform.
Then I trust that envelope. The logbook tells me what happened; the code ensures it was in scope.

## Principles

- **Non-interactive.** Arguments in, output out. Commands compose with pipes, files, and scripts.
- **Caller-agnostic.** Helm serves whoever calls it — human, agent, or script.
- **Bring your own tools.** Helm orchestrates; external tools do the specialized work.
- **Joy matters.** Language shapes how a tool feels to use. The nautical theme is helpful and fun to me. ⛵️
