## How Work Is Organized

Work in this project follows a nautical metaphor that mirrors the tool itself.
Why? Because I'm a nerd, it's fun, and I do my best work when I'm enjoying it.

### Commissions

A **commission** is a GitHub issue that organizes a body of work.
It has three parts:

- **Why** — Why does this work matter now?
- **What** — What are we trying to accomplish?
- **Missions** — A prioritized checklist of issues that get us there. Each one requires a voyage to complete.

Each mission is itself an issue with its own **Why** and **What**.
This structure repeats at every level: motivation, objective, then the work to get there.

### Voyages

A **voyage** is tracked through the helm CLI.
To start work on a mission, create a `resolve-issue` voyage for it.
The voyage records the journey — bearings taken, positions formed, actions executed — as an append-only logbook.

#### Voyage Types

- **Resolve Issue** — A voyage tied to a specific GitHub issue. Most missions use this. The issue frames the voyage: its why/what becomes the voyage's intent, and the voyage is complete when the issue is resolved.
- **Open Waters** — Unscoped, general-purpose. For exploration, spikes, or work that doesn't have a clear issue yet. Often ends with an issue created, turning discovery into a future mission.

More voyage types will be added as helm grows. When they are, corresponding mission types will be documented here.

### Working a Commission

1. Check the commission — see what's next.
2. Start a voyage for the next mission.
3. Work through it. Record bearings. Take actions.
4. Complete the voyage. Check off the mission.
5. Return to the commission.
